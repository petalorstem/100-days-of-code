# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!--### Day 0: October 24, 2021
#####

**Today's Progress**: Finished building the "Technical Document" project for the freecodecamp "Responsive Web Design" certification. Also, started working on the "Portfolio' project. I managed to fulfill all the user stories and now all I have to do is design the page well so it's presentable.

**Thoughts:** I'm struggling with center aligning the content vertically and horizontally but I'll figure it out once and for all tomorrow. I had started this certification at the start of my final semester and then I had to drop everything mid way because "final semester". Now that that's out of the way I'm glad I picked it up again. Although I do need to brush a few concepts which I will do tomorrow since I'll be starting with Javascript the day after. I have been WAITING to get started with it for quite a while and now that it's finally going to happen the day after I'm just super excited !

### Day 1: October 25, 2021
#####

**Today's Progress**: Finished the final project for the "Responsive Web Design" Certification. I learned the simplest technique to center align horizontally and vertically  Using the following:

        display: flex;        
        justify-content: center;        
        align-items: center;
        
I also learned about,

        scroll-padding-top: 100px;
     
so I can avoid the headings from being cut off when I click on a link that takes me to a particular section in the page.

**Thoughts**: It took me really~ long to obtain this certification but I finally did it and it feels really good ! Finally, I'll be starting with JavaScript tomorrow ! I'm going to reward myself with an episode of "Blue Period" and then continue studying for my exam.

### Day 2: October 28, 2021
#####

**Today's Progress**: 14% progress on Basic JavaScript under JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.

**Thoughts:** I am a CS graduate and I know some basics but I'm making notes of everything so my progress is slow. I love learning this way rather than at college. We just skimmed thourgh JavaScript without proper order and just for the sake of completing the syllabus. Though for the project I managed to make a Pomodoro Timer with the crumbs of JavaScript I understood and with help of YouTube tutorials. At the end of this I really want to be able to make one on my own along with other projects.



### Day 3: October 31, 2021
#####

**Today's Progress**: 22% progress on Basic JavaScript under JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.

**Thoughts:** For a few days I'm going to focus on showing up rather than how much I manage to complete since i'm dealing with a lot of inconsistencies. I really need to do something about it. It's best to take small steps at a time.


### Day 4: November 1, 2021
#####

**Today's Progress**: 34% progress on Basic JavaScript under JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification. Learned all about concatenatig strings and accessing letters at various positons in the string and how to find the length of the string. Also learnt that a particular letter in the string cannot be altered but you can assign a whole new string to a variable.

**Thoughts:** It was fun! Today I did feel like showing up and it felt nice. The real test is when I don't feel like showing up.-->


### Day 0: November 8, 2021
#####

**Today's Progress**: Completed 45% of Basic Javascript on freecodecamps "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure" Certification. I learnt about arrays, multidimentional arrays and how to access and modify them, push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), how to write a function, how to call a function, how to pass arguments into a funtion and how to return a value from a function.

**Thoughts:** I've lost the count for how many times I'm restarting the 100 days of code challenge but I'm not going to give up till I get consistent. We fall, we get up ! Today's learning session was great. I always wanted to learn JavaScript and it feels nice to finally learn it.


### Day 1: November 9, 2021
#####

**Today's Progress**: Completed 45% of Basic Javascript on freecodecamps "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure" Certification. I learnt about Scope (Local and Global), undefined return value, assignment with a returned value, simple queue implementation, understanding the boolean data type and using the 'if' statement. 

**Thoughts**: I showed up today, Yaayy! I can totally do this!


### Day 2: November 11, 2021
#####

**Today's Progress**: Completed 63% of Basic Javascript on freecodecamps "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure" Certification. I learnt about arithmetic operators (==, ===,!=, !==, >, >=, <, <=), logical operators (&&, ||), else statement.

**Thoughts**: Couldn't show up yesterday due to some personal reasons but I'll try to show up everyday starting today. Today was easy but fun.


### Day 3: November 15, 2021
#####

**Today's Progress**: Completed 70% of Basic Javascript on freecodecamps "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure" Certification. I learnt about else if statement, the order in if else statements, the if-else chain, the switch statement, the default case in switch statement, how to handle multiple identical options with switch statement.

**Thoughts**: About showing up daily, i guess i spoke,, *cough chough* too soon. It was still fun. I'm literally revising my basics of coding which is essential for what I want to create after my exam.

<!--### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
