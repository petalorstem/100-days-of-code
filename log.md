# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished building the "Technical Document" project for the freecodecamp "Responsive Web Design" certification. Also, started working on the "Portfolio' project. I managed to fulfill all the user stories and now all I have to do is design the page well so it's presentable.

**Thoughts:** I'm struggling with center aligning the content vertically and horizontally but I'll figure it out once and for all tomorrow. I had started this certification at the start of my final semester and then I had to drop everything mid way because "final semester". Now that that's out of the way I'm glad I picked it up again. Although I do need to brush a few concepts which I will do tomorrow since I'll be starting with Javascript the day after. I have been WAITING to get started with it for quite a while and now that it's finally going to happen the day after I'm just super excited !

**Today's Progress**: Finished the final project for the "Responsive Web Design" Certification. I learned the simplest technique to center align horizontally and vertically  Using the following:

        display: flex;        
        justify-content: center;        
        align-items: center;
        
I also learned about,

        scroll-padding-top: 100px;
     
so I can avoid the headings from being cut off when I click on a link that takes me to a particular section in the page.

**Thoughts**: It took me really~ long to obtain this certification but I finally did it and it feels really good ! Finally, I'll be starting with JavaScript tomorrow ! I'm going to reward myself with an episode of "Blue Period" and then continue studying for my exam.

<!--### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
