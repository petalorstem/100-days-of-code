# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished building the "Technical Document" project for the freecodecamp "Responsive Web Design" certification. Also, started working on the "Portfolio' project. I managed to fulfill all the user stories and now all I have to do is design the page well so it's presentable.

**Thoughts:** I'm struggling with center aligning the content vertically and horizontally but I'll figure it out once and for all tomorrow. I had started this certification at the start of my final semester and then I had to drop everything mid way because "final semester". Now that that's out of the way I'm glad I picked it up again. Although I do need to brush a few concepts which I will do tomorrow since I'll be starting with Javascript the day after. I have been WAITING to get started with it for quite a while and now that it's finally going to happen the day after I'm just super excited !

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
